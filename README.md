## Prerequisites

The _requirements.txt_ file should list all Python libraries that the project depends on, and they will be installed automatically using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If by chance some libraries or packages are missing generating some errors during execution a useful tool is [_pipreqs_](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/). To update the _requirements.txt_ file just type

```
pipreqs --force path/to/your/package
```
