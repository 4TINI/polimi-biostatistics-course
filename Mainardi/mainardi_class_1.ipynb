    "Missing values can arise from information loss as well as dropouts and nonresponses of the study participants. The presence of missing values leads to a smaller sample size than intended and eventually compromises the reliability of the study results. The other problem is that of outliers, which refers to extreme values that abnormally lie outside the overall pattern of a distribution of variables."
