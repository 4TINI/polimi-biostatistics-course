Descriptive statistics do not, however, allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have analysed or reach conclusions regarding any hypotheses we might have made. They are simply a way to describe our data. Typically, there are two general types of statistic that are used to describe data:\n",

Inferential statistics are techniques that allow us to use these samples to make generalizations about the populations from which the samples were drawn.
